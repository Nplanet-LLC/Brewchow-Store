2. Right-click on the image
3. Select "Save Image As..."
4. Navigate to: brewhaus-nextjs/public/
5. Save it as: logo-dark.png

STEP 2: Verify the Logo
------------------------
The logo should be saved at this exact path:
brewhaus-nextjs/public/logo-dark.png

STEP 3: Refresh Your Browser
-----------------------------
1. Go to http://localhost:3000
2. Press Ctrl+F5 (or Cmd+Shift+R on Mac) to hard refresh

The code is already updated to use /logo-dark.png
Just save the image file and refresh!

If the logo doesn't appear:
- Check the file is named exactly: logo-dark.png
- Check it's in the public folder
- Try clearing browser cache
- Check browser console for errors (F12)
